# Enhanced Classification with CNN

## Project Overview

This project focuses on enhancing classification accuracy using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). By training the CNN with a well-defined architecture, including convolutional and dense layers, the project achieved an 85% accuracy on the test set, optimizing the model for image classification tasks. Additionally, effective model evaluation was implemented through a confusion matrix analysis, providing insights into the performance of the CNN on different classes. The visualization of the confusion matrix, including a heat map, allows for intuitive interpretation and understanding of the model's predictions, contributing to enhanced model transparency.
